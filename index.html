	<h1>My Pets</h1>	<!--chaning the heading to the highest heading type-->

<p>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</p>
<!--seperates the text with p tags-->

<h4> Dog</h4> <h5>Lula</h5>
    <!--Adding the image src so the img can appear, the alt tags adds the alt tag and the width and height changes the width and height-->
<img src="Puppy.jpg" alt=puppy width=300 height=300>
<p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with. I like to take her to the park. Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball. </p>

<h4>Turtle</h4><h5>Slowpoke</h5>    

<img src="Turtle.jpg" alt=turtle width=300 height=300>
<p>Slowpoke is my turtle. I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>

<h4>Fish</h4> <h5>Hamster</h5>
<img src="Fish.jpg" alt=fish width=300 height=300>
<p>Hamster is the name of my fish. I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway. He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
